[verse 1]
The fire's low, the lights are soft,
The world outside is cold and lost.
But here with you, it feels like spring,
In every breath, the carols sing.

[Pre-Chorus]
You laugh, and time begins to slow,
The stars above start to glow.

[Chorus]
Under the snowlight, holding you near,
Whispering dreams only we can hear.
If love's a season, I'll stay all year.
Under the snowlight, my heart is claer.

[Verse 2]
The clock stricks twelve, the world's asleep,
But in your eyes, the promise keeps.
The gentle hush of falling snow,
Is telling us what hearts should know.

[Bridge]
No needs for gifts, no mistletoe,
Your hands in mine are all I know.
This quiet night, forever's start,
Christmas lives inside my heart.

[Chorus]
Under the snowlight, holding you near,
Whispering dreams only we can hear.
If love's a season, I'll stay all year,
Under the snowlight, my heart is clear.

[Outro]
The world may fade when morning's bright,
But I'll still see you in the snowlight.
